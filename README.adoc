This is a branch of OCaml 4.12.0 that:
- Uses prefetching during marking and sweeping (courtesy of Stephen
  Dolan)
- Records statistic about static data usage during marking: for each
  mark slice, the number of words seen, the number of words skipped
  thanks to the page table, and the number of unique distinct
  cachelines skipped. These statistics are appended to the file
  `/tmp/ocamlskip.log`.

To analyse the log file there is a script at
<https://gitlab.com/gadmm/ocaml-large-pages-experiment/skip_count>.
