This is a branch of OCaml 4.12.0 that:
- Uses prefetching during marking and sweeping (courtesy of Stephen
  Dolan)
- Records statistic about immediates during marking: for each mark
  slice, the number of words seen, the number of immediates seen, and
  the number branches over [Is_block] that were mispredicted using
  2-bit counters over a 14-bit history. These statistics are appended
  to the file `/tmp/ocamlimmediates.log`.
