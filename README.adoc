This is a branch of OCaml 4.12.0 that:
- Uses prefetching during marking and sweeping (courtesy of Stephen
  Dolan)
- Records statistic about immediates during marking: for each mark
  slice, the number of words seen, the number of immediates seen, and
  the number immediates that were mispredicted using a 2-bit counter.
  These statistics are appended to the file `/tmp/ocamlimmediates.log`.
